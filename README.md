## The Collaborative Aerial Swarm Architecture (CASA) ##

Welcome to the main repo for the Collaborative Aerial Swarm Architecture, dubbed CASA for short. The goal of this arcitecture is to leverage open-source software as much as possible to create teh most robust aerial swarming architecure available. We will use ROS2 and PX4-micro-XRCE-DDS on a companion computer talking to a pixawk (running non-custom firmware) via a ftdi cable.

At the heart of CASA is the System Interface Node.
